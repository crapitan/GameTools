# GameTools
Game Framework for MonoGame

This project is my attempt at creating a state manager within monogame.

It will handle all the screens, and screens do all of the loadcontent, update, draw, etc.

This is based on code I found here (which didn't work in it's current state), so I have heavily modified it:
